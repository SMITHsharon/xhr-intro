### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
Uses `Bootstrap` to provide the underlying styling and grid structure for the `html`. 

In addition, various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- Created a `JSON` file, `dinosaurs.json`, containing `key:value` pairs of information for the `dinosaurs` object, including an image file for each
- Writes the `JavaScript` code that executes the XHR Request to `open` the `JSON` file
- Stores the data retrieved from the `JSON` file in the `data` object array
- Writes all of the Dinosaur data in one string to the DOM


### Technologies Used
- `html`
