### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
Various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- Used `Bootstrap` to provide the underlying styling and structure for the `html`
- Created a `JSON` file, `dinosaurs.json`, containing key:value pairs of information for the `dinosaurs` object, including an image file for each
- Wrote the `JavaScript` code that executes the XHR Request to `open` the `JSON` file
- Stored the data retrieved from the `JSON` file in the `data` object array
- Wrote all of the Dinosaur data in one string to the DOM
